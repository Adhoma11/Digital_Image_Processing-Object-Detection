# Digital_Image_Processing-Object-Detection
This repository focuses on image preprocessing techniques and diverse analysis methods essential for enhancing image quality and extracting significant features.
In the initial phase of my project, I concentrate on image preprocessing methods and diverse image analysis techniques. This involves the application of filters, working with histograms, executing transformations, and utilizing the Hough Transform algorithm. These procedures have a vital role in enhancing images, extracting significant features, and preparing them for further analysis.
By utilizing filters like Gaussian or Median filters, I am able to effectively reduce noise and improve the quality of the images. Histograms offer valuable insights into the distribution of pixel intensities, assisting in contrast adjustment and providing an understanding of the image characteristics. Transformations, such as scaling, rotation, and perspective transformation, enable precise geometric manipulations to achieve better alignment or correction.
Moreover, I delve into the powerful Hough Transform technique, which empowers me to detect lines, circles, and other shapes within an image. This method proves particularly beneficial for tasks such as lane detection in autonomous driving or shape identification in medical imaging.
By implementing these image preprocessing techniques and analysis methods, my aim is to establish a strong foundation for the subsequent phase of my project: object detection utilizing YOLO v3 and OpenCV.
